	Our diagrams, which we call statecharts, extend conventional state-transition

  abstract = {The emergence of the UML as a de-facto standard for object-oriented
	modelling has been mirrored by the success of the B method as a practically
	useful formal modelling technique. The two notations have much to
	offer each other. The UML provides an accessible visualisation of
	models facilitating communication of ideas but lacks formal precise
	semantics. B, on the other hand, has the precision to support animation
	and rigorous verification but requires significant effort in training
	to overcome the mathematical barrier that many practitioners perceive.
	We utilise a derivation of the B notation as an action and constraint
	language for the UML and define the semantics of UML entities via
	a translation into B. Through the UML-B profile we provide specialisations
	of UML entities to support model refinement. The result is a formally
	precise variant of UML that can be used for refinement based, object-oriented
	behavioural modelling. The design of UML-B has been guided by industrial
	applications.},
