- Handle defer
- Nested states?
- Possibly we can allow do:s to be interrupted during various operations.
(read,write,send). Do we want to do this?

========================

- Improve entry/do/exit
- Internal transitions

- We permit internal transitions (we have to add a keyword) and entry/exits
in the pseudo-Erlang format, but transform them internally to normal external
transitions (without entry/exit). This permits us to handle both
internal and external transitions well.
